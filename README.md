## Fruit Guesser üçéüçåüçì

**Description:**  
The Fruit Guesser is a fun and interactive web application that uses a machine learning model to identify fruits based on their characteristics. Users can input various attributes such as color, size, texture, taste, and presence of seeds to guess the fruit, and the model provides an accurate prediction.

**Features:**
- Utilizes a decision tree classifier to make predictions.
- Accepts user inputs for color, size, texture, taste, and seeds.
- Provides instant feedback with the predicted fruit.

**How to Use:**
1. Open the web application.
2. Select the attributes of the fruit you want to guess from the dropdown menus.
3. Click the "Submit" button to see the model's prediction.
4. Enjoy guessing different fruits and test your knowledge!

**Technologies Used:**
- Python for model development.
- Streamlit for building the web application.
- Decision tree classifier for fruit classification.
- HTML/CSS for frontend design.

**Future Enhancements:**
- Adding more fruits to the dataset for improved accuracy.
- Implementing user authentication and tracking of guessing history.
- Enhancing the user interface with more interactive features.
